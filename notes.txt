    removeTask(taskTitle){
        let position = this.tasks.findIndex(toDo => toDo.title == taskTitle);
        if (position != -1) {
            this.tasks.splice(position, 1);
        };
    }

in the dropdown menu of the create task modal, store the value of the project selected in currentProject

Next steps:

display dummy tasks

the priority and complete/incomplete status can be appended as classes (maybe use the toggle function in WDS)
the completed tab should probably be its own Project, and the Completed display should always show the number of toDoItems in there
